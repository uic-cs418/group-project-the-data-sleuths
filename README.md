## Problem: Does Chicago experience the luxury effect?

### Luxury effect
A pattern of higher biodiversity in wealthier neighborhoods
### Why we chose this problem
To learn more about the human impact on the environment
### Why care about urban biodiversity?
- Higher biodiversity leads to a healthier ecosystem
- A healthy ecosystem provides many benefits to the community, including Nutrient cycling, Pest and disease control and Mental wellness
### Why birds?
- Birds are a great indicator of the health of our environment
- There is a lot of easily accessible data on birds compared to other wildlife
- Understanding how and why wildlife is distributed can help urban planners design neighborhoods that best supports the ecosystem.
### Hypothesis : There is lower bird diversity in low income Chicago neighborhoods.
### Stakeholders: Chicago City Government, Urban Planners, Nonprofit Organizations
