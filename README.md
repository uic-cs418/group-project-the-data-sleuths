## Problem: Does Chicago experience the luxury effect?

### Luxury effect
A pattern of higher biodiversity in wealthier neighborhoods
### Why we chose this problem
To learn more about the human impact on the environment
### Why care about urban biodiversity?
- Higher biodiversity leads to a healthier ecosystem
- A healthy ecosystem provides many benefits to the community, including Nutrient cycling, Pest and disease control and Mental wellness
### Why birds?
- Birds are a great indicator of the health of our environment
- There is a lot of easily accessible data on birds compared to other wildlife
- Understanding how and why wildlife is distributed can help urban planners design neighborhoods that best supports the ecosystem.
### Hypothesis : There is lower bird diversity in low income Chicago neighborhoods.
### Stakeholders: Chicago City Government, Urban Planners, Nonprofit Organizations

Introduction:    
    We all know that humans have a huge impact on the environment, but we were curious of the extent of that impact in a more local level that affect us as residents of Chicago. Today we would like to present our research on biodiversity in urban areas. We were curious to see if Chicago experiences the luxury effect, which is a pattern of higher biodiversity in urban areas. 
    Now, why is biodiversity important? Higher biodiversity leads to a healthier ecosystem which brings many benefits to a community such as nutrient cycling, pest and disease control, and mental wellness.
    They way we looked into biodiversity was through birds. How do birds help? Well, they are a great environmental health indicator and compared to other wildlife, their data is a lot more accessible.  By understanding how and why wildlife is distributed, can help urban planners design neighborhoods that best supports the ecosystem.
    Our hypothesis is that there is lower bird diversity in Chicagoâ€™s low income neighborhoods. To test our hypothesis, we are looking into two datasets: the Cornell Lab or ornithology- ebird Basic Dataset, and the US Census Bureau- Socioeconomic Indicators for Chicago 2008 to 2012. 
    We believe the most important stakeholders for this research are the Government of the City of Chicago, Urban Planners, and Nonprofit Organizations.
